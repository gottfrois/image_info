## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixes `URI.encode` obsolete warning by using `Addressable` instead.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-07-24
### Added

- Allows to set a maximum image size in bytes to fetch. The HTTP connection

`zero` or a negative number will deactivate this feature. Default to `-1` not
to break retro compatibility.

type was not set properly in this case.
